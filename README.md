## 👋 Hi there! I'm [YourName] a.k.a. The Bug Whisperer 🐛🔮

I'm a web and mobile developer who speaks fluent **JavaScript**, **Python**, and occasionally yells at my terminal in frustration. I wield the mighty powers of:

🛠️ **Frontend Frameworks**  
- ⚛️ React (because everything's better with hooks!)  
- 📱 React Native (apps so smooth they butter your toast)

⚙️ **Backend Magic**  
- 🔗 Node.js (event loops and chill)  
- 🐍 Python (snakes for backend? totally safe, trust me)
